Repository for the paper Automated Hate Speech Detection and the Problem of Offensive Language, ICWSM 2017

This repo is currently private but will be made public when camera-ready paper is done. We can use it to host

(a) Our updated hatespeech lexicon
(b) Include citations to our work.
(c) Perhaps link to our data that were released by CrowdFlower so that we get citations?
(d) Any other resources we want to share
